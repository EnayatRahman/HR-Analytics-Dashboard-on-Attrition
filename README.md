# HR-Analytics-Dashboard-on-Attrition
## HR Analytics Dashboard on Employee Attrition Using Power BI
## Project Overview:
This project aims to provide insights into the factors influencing employee attrition and create a comprehensive HR analytics dashboard using Power BI. The goal is to empower the HR department to monitor and manage employee turnover more effectively and make data-driven decisions to improve retention.
## Problem Statement:
Acme Corporation, a leading tech company, is struggling with high employee turnover. The HR department is concerned about the negative impact of attrition on team dynamics, project continuity, and company morale. To tackle this challenge, Acme Corporation wants to use data analytics to gain insights into the drivers of employee turnover and predict which employees might leave in the near future.

## Dataset:
Acme Corporation has provided historical data on employee demographics, job satisfaction, work environment, performance metrics, and attrition status over the past five years. The dataset contains information on both current employees and those who have left the company, offering valuable insights for analysis.

## Data Analysis and Insights with Power BI:
### 1.  Data Exploration and Visualization:
Interactive Dashboards: Power BI will be used to create interactive dashboards to visualize trends and patterns in employee turnover.
Department and Role Analysis: Analyze the turnover rates across different departments, roles, and projects to identify areas with the highest attrition.
Trend Analysis: Visualize monthly and yearly attrition rates to spot patterns and critical periods for higher employee turnover.
### 2. Descriptive Analytics:
Attrition Causes: Use Power BI to generate detailed reports on the primary reasons for attrition, based on employee feedback and exit interviews.
Factor Impact: Analyze the impact of factors like job satisfaction, work-life balance, workload, and career development opportunities on turnover rates.
Attrition by Tenure: Examine how the length of employment correlates with attrition risk, revealing whether newer employees or long-term staff are more prone to leave.
## Predictive Insights with Power BI:
### 3.Predictive Analytics and Employee Risk Scores:
Attrition Likelihood Prediction: Utilize built-in Power BI integration with machine learning services to develop predictive models estimating the likelihood of employee attrition.
Scenario Analysis: Implement scenario analysis within Power BI to understand the impact of changes in employee satisfaction, salary adjustments, or leadership initiatives on future turnover.
### 4.Proactive Employee Retention:
Risk Identification: HR managers can use the Power BI dashboard to identify employees at high risk of attrition and take proactive measures to improve their engagement and retention.
Retention Strategies: Highlight personalized retention strategies, such as career development plans or work-life balance improvements, for high-risk employees based on the analysis.
## Business Impact and Strategic Workforce Planning:
### 5. Workforce Planning and Management:
Resource Allocation: Use the insights from Power BI to help HR leaders make data-driven decisions about workforce allocation, ensuring that critical projects are adequately staffed.
Strategic HR Decisions: Enable HR leaders to plan for potential attrition spikes by using real-time data to predict staffing needs and minimize disruptions to ongoing projects.
### 6. Continuous Improvement with Power BI:
Dynamic Dashboards: Ensure that the Power BI dashboards update in real-time as new employee data becomes available, providing continuous insights into employee turnover.
Feedback Integration: Implement a feedback loop, where HR interventions and retention outcomes are monitored to improve the overall prediction accuracy and effectiveness of the strategies.
## Conclusion:
This project uses Power BI to create an interactive HR analytics dashboard that helps Acme Corporation tackle employee attrition proactively. By leveraging historical data, predictive analytics, and interactive visualizations, HR managers can gain deep insights into turnover trends and implement targeted strategies to improve employee retention.
